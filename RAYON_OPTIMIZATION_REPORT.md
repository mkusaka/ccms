# Rayon Performance Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

We successfully optimized the Rayon implementation to achieve a **2x performance improvement** through careful profiling and targeted optimizations. The key finding was that sonic-rs JSON parser + jemalloc allocator provides significant benefits for Rayon's parallel processing.

## Performance Benchmarks

| Implementation | Mean Time | vs Baseline | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Rayon (no features) | 399ms | - | Baseline without optimizations |
| Rayon (sonic+jemalloc) | 199ms | **2x faster** | ✅ Optimal configuration |
| Rayon (mmap+memchr) | 261ms | 1.3x slower | ❌ Memory mapping overhead |
| Rayon (mimalloc) | 246ms | 1.2x slower | ❌ Worse than jemalloc |
| Rayon (single-pass) | 223ms | 1.1x slower | ❌ Tracking overhead |

## Profiling Results

Key bottlenecks identified through pprof profiling:
1. **JSON Parsing (28%)**: `simd_json::Deserializer::from_slice`
2. **I/O Operations (17.6%)**: `std::io::Lines` iterator
3. **String Operations (6.3%)**: `to_lowercase` calls
4. **Memory Allocation**: Multiple jemalloc functions

## Optimizations Tested

### ✅ Successful Optimizations

#### 1. sonic-rs JSON Parser
- **What**: Replaced simd-json with sonic-rs
- **Why**: sonic-rs provides better performance for our JSON structures
- **Result**: Part of the 2x overall improvement

#### 2. jemalloc Global Allocator
- **What**: Replaced system allocator with jemalloc
- **Why**: Better memory allocation performance for concurrent workloads
- **Result**: Significant improvement for Rayon's parallel processing

### ❌ Failed Optimizations

#### 1. Memory-Mapped I/O
- **What**: Used mmap with memchr for line scanning
- **Result**: 31% slower due to overhead
- **Why Failed**: Small file sizes and random access patterns don't benefit from mmap

#### 2. mimalloc Allocator
- **What**: Tested mimalloc as alternative to jemalloc
- **Result**: 23% slower than jemalloc
- **Why Failed**: jemalloc is better optimized for our workload

#### 3. Single-Pass Processing
- **What**: Eliminated two-pass file processing
- **Result**: 12% slower
- **Why Failed**: Dynamic timestamp tracking added more overhead than saved

#### 4. Batch Size Optimization
- **What**: Used `with_min_len()` to reduce Rayon task overhead
- **Result**: No improvement
- **Why Failed**: Rayon's default scheduling is already optimal

## Key Learnings

1. **Allocator Choice Matters**: jemalloc provides significant benefits for Rayon's parallel workloads
2. **Parser Performance**: sonic-rs outperforms simd-json for our JSON structures
3. **Simpler is Better**: Complex optimizations like mmap often add more overhead than benefit
4. **Rayon is Already Optimized**: The default Rayon configuration is hard to improve upon

## Recommended Configuration

For optimal Rayon performance, use these Cargo features:
```toml
[features]
default = ["sonic", "jemalloc"]
sonic = ["sonic-rs"]
jemalloc = ["jemallocator"]
```

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Regex Optimization**: Custom SIMD implementations for common patterns
2. **Smarter File Discovery**: Parallel file discovery for large directory trees
3. **Query Optimization**: Pre-compile and cache regex patterns
4. **Adaptive Parallelism**: Adjust thread count based on workload

## Conclusion

We achieved a significant **2x performance improvement** for Rayon through the combination of sonic-rs JSON parser and jemalloc allocator. While other optimization attempts failed, this simple configuration change provides substantial benefits with minimal complexity.
